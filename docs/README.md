# Documentation

## About This Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the ROBO-9 platformer game project. All documentation follows British English conventions and should be maintained to support both development and future contributors.

## Documentation Standards

### Language and Style
- **Language**: All documentation must be written in British English
- **Spelling**: Use British spellings (e.g., "colour" not "color", "realise" not "realize", "centre" not "center")
- **Terminology**: Prefer British terminology where applicable
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout all documents

### Adding New Documentation
When adding new documentation:

1. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `asset-loading-system.md`)
2. **Structure**: Follow the established structure with clear headings and sections
3. **Code Examples**: Include practical code examples where relevant
4. **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation and update this index
5. **Status Tracking**: Use checkboxes and status indicators for implementation progress

### Updating Documentation
- Keep documentation current with code changes
- Update implementation status as features are completed
- Review language for British English compliance
- Ensure all links and references remain valid
