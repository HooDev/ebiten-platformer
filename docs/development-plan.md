```

#### 2. Asset Management
- Sprite sheets for animations
- Tileset for level construction
- Audio files for effects and music
- Level data in JSON or custom format

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- Efficient sprite batching
- Culling off-screen entities
- Optimized collision detection
- Memory management for large levels

## Asset Requirements

### Visual Assets
- [ ] ROBO-9 sprite sheet (idle, walk, jump, climb, damage states)
- [ ] Cat sprite sheet (sad, happy, idle animations)
- [ ] Energy heart sprite with glow animation
- [ ] Tileset for platforms and environment
- [ ] Drone enemies with patrol animations
- [ ] Environmental hazards (spikes, barriers, debris)
- [ ] UI elements and fonts
- [ ] Particle effect textures

### Audio Assets
- [ ] Background music tracks (2-3 ambient pieces)
- [ ] Sound effects:
  - Player movement (footsteps, jump, land)
  - Heart collection
  - Cat interaction (meow, purr)
  - Damage and death sounds
  - Environmental sounds (drone hums, electrical buzzes)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Physics calculations
- Collision detection algorithms
- Game state transitions
- Save/load functionality

### Integration Testing
- Complete gameplay loops
- Level progression
- Performance under load
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Playtesting
- Difficulty curve validation
- User experience feedback
- Bug identification
- Balance adjustments

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Ebitengine limitations**: Research library capabilities early
- **Performance issues**: Profile and optimise regularly
- **Asset pipeline**: Establish workflow early

### Design Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to core features for MVP
- **Difficulty balance**: Regular playtesting
- **Level design**: Create tools and templates

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular milestone reviews
- Prototype risky features early
- Maintain backup plans for complex features
- Focus on core gameplay loop first

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- Consistent 60 FPS on target hardware
- Sub-second level loading times
- Smooth, responsive controls
- Stable performance across platforms

### Gameplay Goals
- Engaging core loop (collect → help → progress)
- Clear difficulty progression
- Intuitive controls and mechanics
- Replayability through secrets and optimisation
